# Anime-rater

This is an application that allows you rate anime shows based on their scores. You can also look up an anime's genres, start date, end date and number of episodes. I created it with vanilla JavaScript and Bulma CSS.

<h3>Issued faced & resolution:</h3>
- It was pretty tough to find a way to create the second modal/drop down at first, but I found a way to make the autoComplete component reusable. I reworked it entirely in another file and destructed all the important functions I needed.
- I also found a way to neatly render the first couple of genres by using the slice method & the join method to make them more readable.

<h3>Technology used:</h3>

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- The Axios library
- Bulma CSS
